\begin{abstract}
A comparison between the finite difference method of Forward Euler and Deep Neural Networks is made in solving a partial differential equation. The effectiveness of different combinations of optimizers and hyper parameters is measured, such as different layer geometries and different activation functions. The most effective combination appeared to consist of the Adam optimizer, one hidden layer layer of $50$ neurons and $\tanh$ as its activation function. This resulted in a maximum difference of $\max(\varepsilon_\mathrm{abs})=4.35\cdot 10^{-5}$ and a cost of $\mathcal{C} = 6.74 \cdot 10^{-7}$. When comparing with the analytical solution a $R^2 \approx 1.0$ and MSE score of $7.27\cdot 10^{-11}$ is found, contrasting the results from Forward Euler of $N_x=100$ and $N_t=10000$ of $R^2=0.88$ and $MSE=1.01\cdot 10^{-5}$.
