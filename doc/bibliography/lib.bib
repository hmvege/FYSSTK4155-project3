	abstract = {We study the topological charge distribution of the SU(3) Yang--Mills theory with high precision in order to be able to detect deviations from Gaussianity. The computation is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo simulations by implementing a naive discretization of the topological charge evolved with the Yang--Mills gradient flow. This definition is far less demanding than the one suggested from Neuberger's fermions and, as shown in this paper, in the continuum limit its cumulants coincide with those of the universal definition appearing in the chiral Ward identities. Thanks to the range of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the results for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge distribution to the continuum limit with confidence by keeping finite volume effects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for the topological susceptibility is t\_0{\textasciicircum}2*chi=6.67(7)*10{\textasciicircum}-4, where t\_0 is a standard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the second we obtain R=0.233(45). The latter is compatible with the expectations from the large Nc expansion, while it rules out the theta-behavior of the vacuum energy predicted by the dilute instanton model. Its large distance from 1 implies that, in the ensemble of gauge configurations that dominate the path integral, the fluctuations of the topological charge are of quantum non-perturbative nature.},

An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest.

The corresponding lattice actions for fermions are constructed and tree-level improvement conditions are derived by considering “classical” improvement. The concept of “on-shell” improvement is generalized to the lattice fermions studied here and the free parameters are determined for O(a) and O(a2) on-shell improved actions to all orders of perturbation theory. No evidence is found that the complicated structure of the O(a2) on-shell improved action, especially thearising fermion contact terms can be removed beyond tree level. The effect of terms in the action that explicitly break chiral symmetry and therefore remove the phenomenon of species doubling are investigated by considering the energy-momentum relations of the arising tree-level improved actions. Our main result is that the O(a) improved action is a slightly modified Wilson fermion action can still be written with only nearest-neighbour fermion interactions.},

Moreover, by transforming the QCD functional integral to an integral over the gauge field at a specified flow time, the emergence of the topological (instanton) sectors in the continuum limit becomes transparent and is seen to be caused by a dynamical effect that rapidly separates the sectors when the lattice spacing is reduced from 0.1 fm to smaller values.},

Moreover, it determines the relative lattice spacings of computations performed at diﬀerent values of the bare coupling, and this is needed for extrapolating results into the continuum. Thus, we calculate a new quantity, w0, for setting the scale in lattice QCD, which is based on the Wilson ﬂow like the scale t0 (M. Luscher, JHEP 1008 (2010) 071). It is cheap and straightforward to implement and compute. In particular, it does not involve the delicate ﬁtting of correlation functions at asymptotic times. It typically can be determined on the few per-mil level. We compute its continuum extrapolated value in 2 + 1-ﬂavor QCD for physical and non-physical pion and kaon masses, to allow for mass-independent scale setting even away from the physical mass point. We demonstrate its robustness by computing it with two very diﬀerent actions (one of them with staggered, the other with Wilson fermions) and by showing that the results agree for physical quark masses in the continuum limit.},
