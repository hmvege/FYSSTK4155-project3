\section{Introduction}
There exists several different approaches that can be used for investigating one of the fundamental building blocks of natural sciences, partial differential equations. The PDEs can appear in almost any field of science, and can give us information about a wide range of topics, such as heat dispersion, wave dynamics, quantum mechanical systems\citep[see][ch. 10]{hjorth-jensen_computational_2015}.

We will be investigating two different approaches to solving partial differential equations. The first method being Deep Neural Networks, and for the second approach will be looking at finite differences. For the latter, we will be using Forward Euler. We will first and foremost be investigating solutions with Deep Neural Networks, and use Forward Euler as a method for comparison.

In the Section 2: Theory, we will be
