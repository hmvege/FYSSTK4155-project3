\section{Theory}
% A large part of Lattice QCD revolves around the attempt to in trying to extract states, particularly exited states. Problems with this is that they are highly correlated and can be difficult to isolate. Techniques to remedy this exists, in particular the variational method\husk{cite here!!}. We will present an alternate method using \husk{what method?}. But in order to begin, let us first begin by looking at what an exited state is and how a novel quantum mechanical approach can be used to illustrate the problem.

% \subsection{Quantum mechanical exited states}
% Let us begin with looking at a toy example, namely the path integral as formulated in quantum mechanics. Consider quantum mechanics in one dimension where we start at an initial position eigenstate $\ket{x_i}$ at time $t_i$ and end up at a final position eigenstate $\bra{x_f}$ at time $i_f$,
% \begin{align}
%     \bra{x_f} \e{-\hat{H}(t_f - t_i)}\ket{x_i} = \int \mathcal{D} x(t) \e{-S[x]}.
%     \label{eq:qm-path-integral}
% \end{align}
% The $\mathcal{D}$ is indicating the \textit{path integral}, which means that we are integrating over all possible paths\cite{peskin_introduction_1995,shankar_principles_1994}. Each of these paths are weighted by some (Wick rotated) action $S[x]$, which is a functional of the path.

% Our goal is to extract exited states from this function \eqref{eq:qm-path-integral}. In order to do that, we have to rewrite

\subsection{A solution to the heat equation}
The partial differential equation we will be investigating is commonly dubbed the heat equation, and has the following shape
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t}
    \label{eq:pde}
\end{align}
given that $t>0$, $x\in [0,L]$. As a shorthand notation, we can write this system as $u_{xx} = u_{t}$. The initial conditions are given as,
\begin{align}
    u(x,0) = \sin(\pi x)
    \label{eq:initial-conds}
\end{align}
for $0 < x < L$ and $L = 1$. The boundary conditions are given as,
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        u(0,t) = 0 \\
        u(0,L) = 0
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:boundary-conditions}
\end{align}
To derive an analytical solution for our PDE, we begin by assuming that the variables are separable,
\begin{align*}
    u(x,t) = X(x)T(t).
\end{align*}
Inserting this into the PDE \eqref{eq:pde}, we get
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^2 \left(X(x)T(t)\right)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial \left(X(x)T(t)\right)}{\partial t}.
\end{align*}
This becomes,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{X(x)}\frac{\partial^2 X(x)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{T(t)}\frac{\partial T(t)}{\partial t},
\end{align*}
in which we see that each side does not depend on the other, such that they are equal to a constant. Calling this constant $-k^2$, we can solve each of them separately. We begin with the temporal part,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{T(t)}\frac{\partial T(t)}{\partial t} = -k^2,
\end{align*}
which has the solution
\begin{align*}
    V(t) = a \e{-k^2t}.
\end{align*}
For the spatial part, we get
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{X(x)}\frac{\partial^2 X(x)}{\partial x^2} = -k^2
    \label{eq:pde-temporal-general}
\end{align}
which we can see has a solution given as\cite{boas_mathematical_2006},
\begin{align}
    X(x) = b\sin(kx).
    \label{eq:pde-spatial-general}
\end{align}
We now need to find $a$, $b$ and $k$. From the initial conditions requirement\eqref{eq:initial-conds}, we get
\begin{align*}
    u(x,t=0) = b\sin(kx) \cdot 1
\end{align*}
Requiring $b=1$ fulfills the initial condition requirement\eqref{eq:initial-conds}. If we then look at the boundary conditions\eqref{eq:boundary-conditions},
\begin{align*}
    u(0,t) &= \sin(k\cdot 0)\e{-k^2t} = 0 \\
    u(L,t) &= \sin(k\cdot L)\e{-k^2t} = 0,
\end{align*}
with the last line giving us that,
\begin{align*}
    kL &= \sin (0) \\
    kL &= n \pi \\
    k &= \frac{n\pi}{L}.
\end{align*}
Summing up, we then have our analytical solution
\begin{align}
    u(x,t) = \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\e{-\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)t}
    \label{eq:pde-analytical-solution}
\end{align}
We can further set $n=1$ and $L=1$, as that will match the initial conditions in equation \eqref{eq:initial-conds}.

\subsection{Forward Euler and finite differences}
Using an explicit scheme, namely forward Euler\citep[ch. 10.2.2]{hjorth-jensen_computational_2015}, the basis for this scheme is in how to approximate the derivative. Using the familiar forward formula for the derivative, we can write the right hand side of \eqref{eq:pde} as,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} &\approx \frac{u(x_i, t_j + \Delta t) - u(x_i, t_j)}{\Delta t} \\
    u_t &= \frac{u_{i,j+1} - u_{ij}}{\Delta t}.
\end{align*}
Rewriting the left hand side of \eqref{eq:pde} using a second derivative approximation, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} &\approx \frac{u(x_i+\Delta x,t_j) - 2u(x_i,t_j) + u(x_i-\Delta x, t_j)}{\Delta x^2} \\
u_{xx} &= \frac{u_{i+1,j} - 2u_{ij} + u_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x^2}.
\end{align*}
Setting these two numerical approximations equal to each other, we can solve for the next iteration in the time direction.
\begin{align*}
    u_{i,j+1} - u_{ij} = \alpha (u_{i+1,j} - 2 u_{ij} + u_{i-1,j}),
\end{align*}
with $\alpha = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$. Solving for $u_{i,j+1}$, we get
\begin{align}
    u_{i,j+1} = \alpha u_{i+1,j} + (1 - 2 \alpha) u_{ij} + \alpha u_{i-1,j}.
    \label{eq:explicit-forward-euler-discretized}
\end{align}
With a keen eye we can recognize this as a simple iterative matrix equation,
\begin{align}
    V^{j+1} = (I - \alpha D) V^j,
    \label{eq:fw-euler-matrix}
\end{align}
with $I$ simply being the identity matrix and $D$ being a tridiagonal matrix of with $-1$ along the of-diagonals and $2$ at the diagonal.
% \begin{align}
%     D = \begin{pmatrix}
%         2 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & 0 \\
%         -1 & 2 & -1 & \cdots & \cdots & 0 \\
%         0 & -1 & 2 & \cdots & \cdots & 0 \\
%         \vdots &  &  & \ddots & & \vdots \\
%         0 & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & 2 & -1 \\
%         0 & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & -1 & 2 \\
%     \end{pmatrix}
% \end{align}

\subsubsection{Stability condition of explicit Forward Euler}
The stability condition of Forward Euler is given as $\alpha = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \leq 1/2$. To prove this, we
